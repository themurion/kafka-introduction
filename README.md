# Kafka Training

## Presentation

The presentation can be found in the branch `gh-pages` and on .

## The Hands-On

The idea is that during the hands-on we implement a Black Jack Tool. All communication between dealers and
players are done via events.

This branch is the final hands-on solution. The idea is to start with the first step (Branch `step-0`) and 
fix the tests. They are entitles, so each "part" is one step. So if all tests that start with "Step 1" are
working, that part is finished.

You can always skip one part by checking out the solution for the step (Branch `step-1` is the solution for Part 1).
